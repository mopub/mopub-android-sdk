## Download

The MoPub SDK is available via:

1. **jCenter AAR**
    
    [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/mopub-android-sdk/images/download.svg)](https://bintray.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/mopub-android-sdk/_latestVersion)  
    The MoPub SDK is available as an AAR via jCenter; to use it, add the following to your `build.gradle`.
    
    ```
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        compile('com.mopub:mopub-sdk:4.7.0@aar') {
            transitive = true
        }
    }
    ```

    **To continue integration using the mopub-sdk AAR, please see the [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/wiki/Getting-Started#updating-your-android-manifest).**

2. **Zipped Source**

    The MoPub SDK is also distributed as zipped source code that you can include in your application.  MoPub provides two prepackaged archives of source code:

    **[MoPub Android Full SDK.zip](http://bit.ly/YUdU9v)**  
    _Includes everything you need to serve MoPub ads *and* built-in support for Millennial Media third party ad network - [Millennial Media](http://www.millennialmedia.com/) - including the required third party binaries._
    
    _**Note:** Millennial Media has updated their minimum supported version of Android to 4.1 (API level 16+). The MoPub Android Full SDK manifest and build.gradle files have been updated accordingly._
    
    _**Note:** Millennial Media has deprecated support for Ant/Eclipse; migrating users should use the MoPub Android base SDK and follow [Millennial's Ant/Eclipse Integration Guide](http://docs.millennialmedia.com/android-ad-sdk/ant-eclipse-integration-guide.html)._
    
    **[MoPub Android Base SDK.zip](http://bit.ly/YUdWhH)**  
    _Includes everything you need to serve MoPub ads.  No third party ad networks are included._
    
    **For additional integration instructions, please see the [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/wiki/Getting-Started#requirements-and-dependencies).**

3. **Cloned GitHub repository**
    
    Alternatively, you can obtain the MoPub SDK source by cloning the git repository:
    
    `git clone git://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk.git`
    
    **For additional integration instructions, please see the [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/wiki/Getting-Started#requirements-and-dependencies).**

For instructions on adding dependencies for Eclipse projects, see our [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/wiki/Getting-Started#adding-the-support-libraries-to-your-project)

## Important Message About Upgrading to MoPub SDK 4.4.0+

Version 4.4.0 of the MoPub SDK fixes a security issue identified by Google. Note that only publishers who received a message from Google are affected. While not all publishers are impacted, we recommend you upgrade to SDK 4.4.0+ ahead of Google's deadline (July 11, 2016) to avoid any issues submitting updates to your apps after the date. More information can be found in [Google's support article](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/6345928).

## Working with Android 6.0 Runtime Permissions
If your app's target SDK is 23 or higher _**and**_ the user's device is running Android 6.0 or higher, you are responsible for supporting [runtime permissions](http://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html), one of the [changes](http://developer.android.com/about/versions/marshmallow/android-6.0-changes.html) introduced in Android 6.0 (API level 23). In addition to listing any dangerous permissions your app needs in the manifest, your app also has to explicitly request the dangerous permission(s) during runtime by calling method `requestPermissions()` in the [`ActivityCompat`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/app/ActivityCompat.html) class.

### Specifically for the MoPub SDK:
- Dangerous permission [`ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION) is needed to pass network location data to MoPub.
- Dangerous permission [`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION) is needed to pass GPS location data to MoPub.
    - Granting `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` also allows network location data to be passed to MoPub without the need to also grant `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`.
- Dangerous permission [`WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) is needed for MRAID 2.
- _**Note:** The user can deny granting any dangerous permissions during runtime, so please make sure your app can handle this properly._
- _**Note:** The user can revoke any permissions granted previously by going to your app's Settings screen, so please make sure your app can handle this properly._
